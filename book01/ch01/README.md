# Welcome to Java

## What is Java, and Why Is It So Great?

### Platform independence

platform independence
: Java programs can be run on many types of computers.

- other languages provide compatible compilers for different platforms

compiler
: the program that translates source code into a form that can run on a given platform

- platform dependent compilers never really worked. You would have to maintain different versions of a program for each supported platform.

virtual machine (JVM)
: JVM is like a "hypothetical computer platform - a design for a computer that doesn't exist in actual hardware." 

- the [Java] compiler translates Java into the machine language of the JVM (ie *bytecode*)

>Java is a true compiled language; it's just compiled to the machine language of the JVM rather than to the machine language of an actual computer platform.

### Object orientation

object
: a programming entity that represents either some real-world object or an abstract concept.
: two characteristics: data(state) and behavior(methods)

class
: the program code you write to create objects
