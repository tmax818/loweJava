# Chapter 1: Understanding Object-Oriented Programming

## What is object-oriented programming?

## Understanding objects

### objects have identity
### objects have type
### objects have state
### objects have behavior

## Understanding the life cycle of an object


## Working with related classes

### inheritance
### interfaces

## designing a program with objects

>The most important part of developing an object-oriented program is designing the classes used to create the programs objects

- break a large problem into a set of classes manageable in size and complexity
- write Java code to implement those classes

>One common way to design object-oriented application si to divide the application into several layers that provide distinct types of functions.
